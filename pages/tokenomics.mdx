## **6. Project Roadmap**

Our platform leverages the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to reduce risk, protect privacy, and solidifies authenticity. Storing and sharing the documents in a zero-knowlege and private way is our core focus at idSign. No one, not even us will have access to the files uploaded except the creator and the parties they shared it with. We achieve this using a new technology we developed leveraging MPC technology and Decentralized Key Management to successfully Token Gate access control rules of the files on the MPC blockchain instead of a centralized API like most projects do!

B. TRUE Decentralized Token-Gating using MPC Key Management System

> A New system we are building that leverages Multi-Party Computation Blockchain and ZK-SmartContracts to create Access Control Lists on the uploaded files and share access of the encryption key Through the MPC blockchain. Files will be Stored on a Decentralized storage and only be accessible by the owner and parties they share it with. Even idSign employees can Never decrypt user files.
